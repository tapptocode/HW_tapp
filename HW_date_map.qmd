## Question 1:

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# First we'll generate a sequence of dates going by 2 months
dates <- seq.Date(as.Date("2015-01-01"), as.Date("2025-12-31"),by = "2 months") 

#Then we extract the year, quarter, and ISO week number from that sequence 
extracted_year <- year(dates)

extracted_quarter <-quarter(dates)

extracted_ISO <- isoweek(dates)
```

## Question 2:

```{r}
sample_dates <- c("2018-03-15","2020-07-20","2023-01-10","2025-09-05")
sample_dates <- as.Date(sample_dates) ### Converts our concatenated list into dates
```

```{r}
week_diff <- numeric(3) ### creates an empty vector to store the differences we'll calculate

### for loop to go through each consecutive pair and calculate the difftime in weeks
### difftime is then stored in the empty vector week_diff
for (i in 1:3) {
  week_diff[i] <- difftime(sample_dates[i+1],sample_dates[i],units = "weeks") 
}

week_diff
```

```{r}
month_diff <- numeric(3) ### creates an empty vector to store the differences we'll calculate

### for loop but this time with time_length instead of difftime
### month difference stored in empty vector month_diff
for (i in 1:3) {
  month_diff[i] <- time_length(interval(sample_dates[i],sample_dates[i+1]),"months")
}

month_diff
```

## Question 3:

```{r}
### Provided list below
num_lists <- list(c(4,16,25,36,49),c(2.3,5.7,8.1,11.4), c(10,20,30,40,50))

### Getting the means, medians, and standard deviations for each of the list's vectors using map() and assigning them to n_l_*function*
n_l_mean <- map(num_lists,mean)

n_l_median <- map(num_lists,median)

n_l_sd <- map(num_lists,sd)
```
