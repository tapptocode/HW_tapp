## Question 1:

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# First we'll generate a sequence of dates going by 2 months
dates <- seq.Date(as.Date("2015-01-01"), as.Date("2025-12-31"),by = "2 months") 

#Then we extract the year, quarter, and ISO week number from that sequence 
extracted_year <- year(dates)

extracted_quarter <-quarter(dates)

extracted_ISO <- isoweek(dates)
```
